# Build a Serverless Hexo Website

## Quick Start

Build a serverless hexo website with serverless website component, it's fast and no need to pay attention on configuring different cloud services.

&nbsp;

- [请点击这里查看中文版部署文档](./README.md)

&nbsp;

1. [Install](#1-install)
2. [Configure](#2-configure)
3. [Deploy](#3-deploy)
4. [Remove](#4-remove)
5. [Account (optional)](#5-account-optional)

&nbsp;

### 1. Install

**Applications you need to install before deploying**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Should be at least Node.js 8.6, recommends 10.0 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

If you don't install these applications, you could go to [Installation](https://hexo.io/docs/index.html) as a reference.

**Install Serverless Framework**
```
$ npm install -g serverless
```

**Install Hexo**
```
$ npm install -g hexo-cli
```

Once Hexo is installed, run the following commands to initialize Hexo in the target `hexo` folder.

```
$ hexo init hexo   # init a hexo folder
$ cd hexo
$ npm install
```

Once initialized, here’s what your project folder will look like:
```
.
├── _config.yml
├── package.json
├── scaffolds
├── source
|   ├── _drafts
|   └── _posts
└── themes
```

After installation, you could use `hexo g` to generate static pages.
```
hexo g   # generate
```

> Note: You could use the following command and visit `localhost:4000` to test the hexo website locally.

```
hexo s   # server
```

### 2. Configure

Create `serverless.yml` file in the project, and configure the yaml.

```console
$ touch serverless.yml
```

```yml
# serverless.yml

myWebsite:
  component: "@serverless/tencent-website"
  inputs:
    code:
      src: ./hexo/public # Upload static files generated by HEXO
      index: index.html
      error: index.html
    region: ap-guangzhou
    bucketName: my-bucket
```

Here’s what your project folder will look like after configuration:

```
.
├── .serverless
├── hexo
|   ├── public
|   ├── ...
|   ├── _config.yml
|   ├── ...
|   └── source
└── serverless.yml
```

### 3. Deploy

Use `sls` command to deploy your project, you could also add `--debug` to see the detail information in the process.

If you have a `Wechat` account, you don't need to configure the `.env` file, just scan the QR code in terminal and sign-up a new account of Tencent Cloud. It's a streamlined experience.

If you don't have a wechat account, you could jump to [account](#5-account-optional) step and configure the account info.

```
$ serverless --debug

```
