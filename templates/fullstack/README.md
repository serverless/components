# Serverless Fullstack Application

The goal of this project is to offer a Fullstack Serverless Application with a composable, reusable architecture, via the power of Serverless Components.

This example will included, but is not limited to:

* Front-end: (Website, Mobile)
* API: (REST API, Graph, Websockets)
* Async: (Message Queue, PubSub, Event-Driven)
* Infrastructure Resources (DynamoDB, S3, etc.)
* Pre-written logic for common use-cases.
